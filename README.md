# TiedNets
TiedNets is a simulator of cascading failures in interdependent networks, written in Python.

It is composed of a set of packages to:

* **create** couples of interdependent networks
* **simulate** attacks on networks and examine cascading failures
* **gather** the results of multiple simulations and combine them

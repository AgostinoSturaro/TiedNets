# TiedNets
TiedNets is a simulator of cascading failures in interdependent networks, written in Python.

It is composed of a set of packages to:

* **create** couples of interdependent networks
* **simulate** attacks on networks and examine cascading failures
* **gather** the results of multiple simulations and combine them

## Documentation
The [Wiki](https://github.com/TiedNets/TiedNets/wiki) contains the overview of the tools and general information you'll need to work with it.

## Getting it to work
The recommended Python version is 2.7, but most things should work fine with newer 3.2+ versions.  
The easiest way to install Python and all the needed packages is probably using the [Anaconda installer](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

If you want to use an IDE, you can this project with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
